			    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen traveling to any country other than your own, it is a good idea to brush up on the local customs and etiquette.
			    Knowing both the local social and business customs could just make that needed difference for your meeting or trip,
			    or help make potential new friends or business partnerships. Inside and using the links below, you will get a brief,
			    but useful glance at some of the local German customs and norms. Much like anything else, however, this is not the
			    only useful tool and knowledge base, and you are encouraged to do some searching of your own.

		    Greetings
		</center>
	    
		<p>
		    <center><img src="imgs/fancypants.gif" class="imgSize2"><br></center>
		    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGermany is a country that uses formal greetings. It is useful to know the difference between the two. An informal greeting would be simply saying
		    'hi,' 'bye,' or 'see you' to a person, and leaving it at that. A formal greeting is considered something such as saying 'Hello Mr./Ms./Mrs. Smith,'
		    or It was nice meeting you today  Mr./Ms./Mrs. Smith.' Proper introductions are also included within this formal greeting. An example of a proper
		    introduction would be 'Mr./Ms./Mrs. Smith, I would like to introduce you to John Doe.' Please notice that these formal greetings include titles and
		    surnames, are you should continue to use these until given the proper cues from the person to use their first name.

		    Dining
		</center>
	    
		<p>
		    <center><img src="imgs/dinnerplate.png" class="imgSize2"><br></center>
		    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnce you are past meeting new people, you may run into a time where you are invited over. If you do end up meeting your new acquaintances for a meal,
		    the following information may be of use to you. First and foremost, Germans are very punctual people; never arrive early to an event with a set time, and rather show up within
		    the first fifteen minutes or so of the given time. If you do end up thinking that you may be late, do call ahead and explain your absence.
		    
		    <br><br>
			
		    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExpanding on the formalities of etiquette please note that, depending on your closeness to the people you are visiting, you may want to remain standing
		    until given a social cue to sit or if you are seated by the hosts. Keep in mind typical European table manners, as well. Table setup for a formal dinner will typically be Continental
		    or European style, which means the fork will be on the left side and the knife will be on the right. You are to use them as such, and it is considered improper to swap back and forth
		    with the utensils. 
		</p>

		    Quiet Hours
		</center>
		
		<p>
		    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBy law, there are quiet hours in Germany. During the days of Monday through Saturday, between the hours of 10PM to 7AM, then from 1PM to 3PM no loud noises
		    of any kind are to be tolerated or allowed. On Sundays and certain holidays this quiet time is to last all day. This includes, but isn't limited to, children running around playing
		    loudly outside, loud radios, televisions, or music. Lawn care tools are also included within this, as well. Also note that any parties that may be hosted by a person, if it is to last
		    into these quiet hour periods, should let neighbors know a few days ahead of time by either letter or in person. Even with a warning, neighbors can, if they wish, complain to authority
		    about any loud noises going on around them.

		<p>
		    <center><img src="imgs/handshake.gif" class="imgSize2"><br></center>
		    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGermany is a country that separates business and personal lives quite well. When it comes to making a business partnership or deal, you do not need to
		    have a long and outstanding personal relationship with the person you are doing business with. The person will, rather, look at your previous credentials and work, as well as
		    your company's history and make their opinions or decisions from there. Much like standard social greetings, business communications are also formal and should be completely
		    professional. Exaggerations and generally over-hyped deals will not get you very far, as Germans tend to be extremely direct and blunt. 
		</p>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<center>
		    Meetings
		</center>
	    
		<p>
		    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMeetings are typically formal and being punctual is key. Creating appointments in advance is usually mandatory, and may need to be posted a few days in
		    advance. As with any other business meeting, being on time is extremely important. If you are to be delayed getting to the meeting for any reason, phone or message ahead to let
		    the group know and to apologize. Meetings are to stick to a schedule and agenda, and you should include both start and end times to give the meeting goers a rough sense of how
		    long the meeting will last. Note that initial meetings may be used simply to get to know each other as potential business partners. When entering a meeting being hosted by a
		    local/German business, please remember that there is a very strict formality for entering the meeting room. The higher ranking business people will enter before all others, from
		    highest to lowest rank within the company, men leading in before women.
		</p>

		    Negotiations
		</center>
	    
		<p>
		    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBusiness negotiations with Germans can be a bit tricky, but do have a strict set of protocols for the most part. When first entering the negotiation room,
		    do not sit until you are absolutely told to. If told to sit in a specific seat, do so. As with meetings, a negotiation will have an absolutely predetermined agenda with both start
		    and end times, as well as what will be negotiated. While not an absolute, most German negotiations will be very light on small talk and straight to business, as they want to stick
		    to the schedule. Both you and your company's credentials, certifications, and history will be looked into in regards for the negotiation or contract. If there are any questions on
		    the contract being signed, expect to go through every last detail until everyone is satisfied. Patience for this particular part is key, as Germans are very detail oriented. Note
		    that any decision making on the German side of a business will be done in a hierarchical way, or in other words, the higher up company members are the decision makers.
